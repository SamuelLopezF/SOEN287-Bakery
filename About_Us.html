					<h3> Our History </h3>
					<p> Random team description I C&P from the internet<br>
						Sweet Lee’s Rustic Bakery was established in early 2010 in Saint Henri, Montreal, by siblings Liana & Greg Lessard. Shortly afterwards, 
						their mother Claudia Settels joined the team to share their passion and love for food with the public. As the company grew, 
						Sweet Lee’s began supplying several quality establishments on a daily basis around the island of Montreal, 
						and now has a list of reputable clients within the third wave and independent café scene of Montréal.

					<h3> Our Team </h3>
					<p> Random Cooks description I C&P from the internet<br>
						Cooks often think only of the team in the kitchen. The kitchen staff members may think of themselves as a team (“us”) allied against the front of house staff (“them”). 
						The kitchen staff on other shifts, management, and other components of the operation may also be considered “them.” This is not productive in a well-functioning restaurant. 
						The staff may believe that if only “they” were more understanding, worked harder, or knew what it was really like, “we” could do the best job. 
						Of course, this same thinking is prevalent in the other groups except in reverse.

					<h3> Our Service </h3>
					<p> Random Service description I C&P from the internet<br>
						This new space would allow for a 50 person dining room, a summer terrace, and for our partnership with Saint-Henri Micro-torréfacteur to blossom into a ‘mini-food-court’, 
						where patrons could enjoy our baking and food expertise, accompanied by Saint-Henri’s delicious in-house roasted coffees, teas and homemade sodas.
