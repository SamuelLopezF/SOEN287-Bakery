					<h3> Our History </h3>
					<p>
						We are a small bakery located in the downtown of Guayaquil city. We opened our doors in 2015. 
						Before we started this business we had a restaurant. There were many other restaurants in the area 
						so there was a lot of competition. We were already selling steamed buns and red bean paste pastries so we thought 
						of opening a business focused on that.
					</p>

					<h3> Our Team </h3>
					<p> Random Cooks description I C&P from the internet<br>
						Cooks often think only of the team in the kitchen. The kitchen staff members may think of themselves as a team (“us”) allied against the front of house staff (“them”). 
						The kitchen staff on other shifts, management, and other components of the operation may also be considered “them.” This is not productive in a well-functioning restaurant. 
						The staff may believe that if only “they” were more understanding, worked harder, or knew what it was really like, “we” could do the best job. 
						Of course, this same thinking is prevalent in the other groups except in reverse.
